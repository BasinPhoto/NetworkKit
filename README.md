## Features

- **Combine Framework Integration:** Leverage the power of Combine to streamline asynchronous operations and handle complex data flows effortlessly.

- **Async/Await Support:** Embrace modern Swift programming with async/await, simplifying asynchronous code and making your networking logic cleaner and more readable.

- **Closures for Flexibility:** Customize your networking calls with closures, providing a flexible and modular approach to handle responses, errors, and more.

## Examples

    public protocol Networkable {
       func sendRequest<T: Decodable>(endpoint: EndPoint) async throws -> T
       func sendRequest<T: Decodable>(endpoint: EndPoint, resultHandler: @escaping (Result<T, NetworkError>) -> Void)
       func sendRequest<T: Decodable>(endpoint: EndPoint, type: T.Type) -> AnyPublisher<T, NetworkError>
    }
